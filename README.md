Analysis code

The Historical-Evaluation scripts calculates and plots statistical measures (bias, pattern correlation, ratio of standard deviation) used for historical evaluation at annual and seasonal scales.

The Future-Changes provides projected future changes at regional scale and scripts to create heat map plots.

Probability-Density-Plots scripts are used to create the probability density plots for extreme and mean indices.
